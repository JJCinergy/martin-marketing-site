                  Jordan is a Supervising Art Director based in NYC with over 25 years of 
                  experience in Film and Television. Having assembled over 30 Art Departments,

                  Creating Martin comes from Jordan's passion for helping fellow production 
                  professionals work through problems and develop their careers. As a 
                  department head, he recognized the systemic issues that challenge every 
                  production department and developed software to address them. Martin helps 
                  creative teams quickly break down scripts and organize their work, saving each 
                  department hours or days of prep time while improving communication across 
                  the entire production.

                On every production, Martin is that one indispensable person who always knows what's 
                happening. They've read every script, tracked every change, studied every schedule, and 
                connected with every department. They're simply on top of it all. That's the spirit we've 
                captured in this software.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                The real Martin was my close colleague and dear friend who passed away recently. He 
                embodied everything this software represents - dedication, attention to detail, and an 
                unwavering commitment to helping everyone around him succeed. This product is dedicated to the memory of the amazing and beloved Martin.
